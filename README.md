Superconductors are non-traditional metallic materials (ie suitably added with compounds such as to allow them to develop specific characteristics) and which possess the property of not opposing resistance to the passage of current.

Apart from the very considerable savings in terms of thermal energy dispersion (the so-called Joule effect), the Superconductors are able to transport large quantities of electrical energy over reduced cable sections, which circulate there without ever reducing its current, measured in Amperes. (A) even low potential differences, measured in Volts (V).

The Superconductor, that is, it does not develop, or develops in a minimal part, the resistive effect, measured in Ohm (Ω) thanks to the effect of the so-called "Cooper pairs", which create paths for the passage of electrons with zero resistivity.

Their limit is set by the (very low) temperatures at which they have to work, although the latest research, especially those for use in super-computers, shows that there are superconductors capable of working even close to 0 ° Celsius.

Superconductivity, allowing a huge passage of current even at relatively low voltages, determines the creation of magnetic fields of high capacity, which thanks to Lenz's Law, are created orthogonally with respect to the passage of current in a cable.

Then, if the cable is wound on itself (coil) and therefore forms an electromagnet and it is made of superconductive material, we are talking about magnetic fields such as to be able to produce (if properly inserted in a rotor, which rotates around a stator) both equipped of the aforementioned superconducting coils, the continuous production of clean energy, on a large scale and without dispersion (at optimal regimes), self-feeds and with an output measurable from hundreds, if not thousands of Kilowatts up to tens of Megawatts (depending on the size of the turbine, its initial energy load (DDP-Difference Of Potential) of check and rotation speed.
